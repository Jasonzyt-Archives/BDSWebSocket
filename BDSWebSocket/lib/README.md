# CryptoPP Static Library
CryptoPP Static Library file is too Large(over 100MB), so we can't upload it to GitHub.  
Please download it by yourself.  
It's very easy:  
1. Make sure you have `vcpkg` (https://github.com/Microsoft/vcpkg)
2. Execute command (in `Powershell` or `cmd`): `vcpkg install cryptopp:x64-windows`
3. Wait a moment
4. copy `[Your vcpkg path]\packages\cryptopp_x64-windows\lib\cryptopp-static.lib` to this folder
5. Done
